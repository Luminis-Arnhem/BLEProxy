# BLEProxy
A Mac application to act as a proxy between BLE devices and clients.

You can run this application from XCode. However before you start the proxy application, make sure the edit values in BLEConstants.swift to ones that match the BLE device you want to proxy to connect to.

When the proxy is active you can use PacketLogger from the [additional tools for XCode](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?=xcode) to view all BLE traffic.
